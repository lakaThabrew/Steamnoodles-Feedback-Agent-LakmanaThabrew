The noodles were absolutely delicious, and the delivery was so fast!
The soup was cold when it arrived, very disappointing.
The noodles are okay, nothing special but not bad either.
The portion size was too small for the price I paid.
Best noodles I've ever had! Highly recommend to everyone.
Everything was okay, nothing stood out though.
Delivery was late, and the noodles were soggy by the time I got them.
The app interface is fine, but it could be more user-friendly.
Amazing experience! The staff was friendly, and the noodles were perfect.
