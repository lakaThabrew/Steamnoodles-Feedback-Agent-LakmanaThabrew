At SteamNoodles, we take pride in serving our dishes hot and fresh, and it's clear that we fell short of that standard in your case. I'd like to make things right - could you please tell me a little more about your order, such as the order number or the date and time you received it? This will help me look into what went wrong and ensure that we take steps to prevent it from happening again in the future.
